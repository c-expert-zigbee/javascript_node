## Brief
This app is a shopping list that aims to provide a functionally useful code that allows a user to create a shopping list quickly and easily. The shopping list is customisable, infinitely extendable, and replaceable, allowing it to be used by anyone. The shopping list has a variety of functions, including an adding system, deleting system, completion indication, and “bought” verification. This means that an individual can add an item to a shopping list, strike it when it is added to kart, then verify that it has been bought, before deleting the item all together to allow for a new list of groceries to be made.
## Coding
The coding of this project was conducted using a “less is more” approach, i.e., the more efficient and selective I could make my code the better, since the use of code to make a web-based interface often results in an excess code. The code was split into structural, styling, and behavioural code using html, css, and javascript to conform with the best practice learning objectives. Commenting is intensive, with the purpose of allowing me full understanding of every section of code in the future, were I to reference this project for insight or inspiration sometime in the future.

## UX/UI
The UI is simplistic and intuitive, with the aim of being simple and easy to use. There is one major input area, where an item can be listed before being added to the shopping data list using a button indicated by a kart symbol. The bin indicator is a button used for removing an item if it is there by mistake or if it is no longer needed on the list. The filter function allows filtering of items between those that have been added to the kart, those which have not, and those which have been bought. The items are listed in chronological order as the user adds them from bottom to top of the list. There is also an indicator of how many items are on the list, which changes with the filter function to allow a user to know exactly how many items they have yet to add/buy.
